# ForestFires

Predicting burned area in the forest fires dataset, first presented by Paulo Cortez and An√≠bal Morais https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires

I was asked to spend a few hours exploring this problem by a persepctive employer. This is a difficalt problem, a robust solution should take more than a few hours!

The repository contains the notebook I submitted to the employer, the dataset, the pickled "best" model, a script to predict burned area from a fire instance and the original Cortez and Morais paper.
